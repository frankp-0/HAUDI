Description: HAUDI is an R package for constructing polygenic scores
  in admixed individuals. Inspired by GAUDI, HAUDI is an efficient
  Lasso-based method which shrinks ancestry-specific effects together
  while encouraging sparsity. It provides helpful functions for
  converting RFMix and FLARE input, and it provides a re-implementation of GAUDI.
